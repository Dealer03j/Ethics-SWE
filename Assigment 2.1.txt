For my assignment I chose the ethical dilemma of data brokers. I felt the following ethical quandaries came with this subject ownership, data anonymization, advancement of technologies and consent. 


I felt the subject of ownership primarily affected the systems of society and personal finances. I chose these two because I feel like the idea of ownership of data as a society is fundamentally misunderstood. Foremost because the average citizen does not understand the value of their data. For a similar reason I chose the ethical quandary of advancement of technologies as customers who provided that data do not know to whom their data is being sold and what it is being used for. That is why I said it affected society. For the quandary of consent I said it affects societal, as most data people who offer up their data are doing it unknowingly. Lastly, the quandary of data anonymizing affects personal life, personal finances, and security. I determined this to be so if data is not anonymized it can cause issues to everyone of these systems.
